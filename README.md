### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi I'm Pawan Bathe, I am working as Software Engineer at Qualcomm, San Diego. <br>
I have keen interest in Software Automation. <br>
I am specialized in Test Frameworks Development, Test Tools Development and Test Automation <br>
These days I am exploring Static Analysis for Software Security, though I am just beginner in this domain. <br>

When I am not writing a code, I am either reading or watching TV series.<br>
